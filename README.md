wxpoly
======

wxPoly is a wxPython application I wrote when I was first learning python primarily for the purpose of exploring the basic wxPython API.

Dependencies
------------

Aside from python 2.* this program uses the wx module.

* In Bodhi and presumably ubuntu/debian install python-wxgtk2.8.
* Other distros check your package manager or http://www.wxpython.org.
* Windows or Mac users you are on your own, but I had it working in Windows so ....

Also note I updated argument parsing to the argparse module which is included in python 2.7 and greater.
But users of python 2.6 will need to install it: `sudo pip install argparse`

Warning
-------

I haven't looked at the code since 2008 and make no promises as to the functionality or sanity
of the code. Possibly uploading it here will motivate me to re-examine it in time.

Then again maybe not ;)
